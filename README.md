# Code Converter App

 In Digital Electronics, We use number systems for representing information. In digital computer, there are four number systems used often. They are:
  
  1. Binary number system
  2. Hexadecimal number system
  3. Octal number system
  4. Decimal number system

Here is my application which is used to convert numbers between these above systems. Streamlit is used to create a intercative interface for the application and it is hosted using Heroku app. You can visit the website [here]( https://codeconverterapp.herokuapp.com/).

## Note:
  I hope you all familiar with dynos. Dynos is the light-weight linux container that holds our app. In order to preserve dynos from burning out, heroku puts your app to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. So this is what makes the app slow to load.
